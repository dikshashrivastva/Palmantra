# Palmantra

**Palmantra** is a React-based web application that allows users to upload or capture an image of their palm and then guides them to visually identify important palm lines such as the Heart Line, Head Line, and Life Line — without using AI.  
It’s designed for those interested in palmistry who want an interactive, easy-to-use tool for self-learning and exploration.
